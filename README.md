# Language Learning Game

This is a simple Java console-based application that helps users learn a new language by testing their translation skills. The game presents a series of English words, and the user is prompted to input the corresponding translations in the target language.

## How to Play

1. **Welcome Message**: Upon starting the game, the user is greeted with a welcome message.
2. **Translation Prompt**: The game presents a series of English words, and for each word, the user is prompted to input the translation in the target language.
3. **Feedback**: After each input, the program provides feedback on whether the translation provided by the user is correct or incorrect. If correct, the user receives a "Correct!" message. If incorrect, the correct translation is displayed.
4. **Game Over**: Once all words have been translated, the game ends, and a "Game over" message is displayed.

## How to Run

To run the game:

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile the `LanguageLearningGame.java` file using `javac LanguageLearningGame.java`.
3. Run the compiled program using `java LanguageLearningGame`.
